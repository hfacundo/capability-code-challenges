     # Jewels and Stones

     You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have.
     Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

     Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

     Example 1:
         Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"
         Output: 3

     Example 2:
         Input: jewels = "z", stones = "ZZ"
         Output: 0

     Constraints:

         * 1 <= jewels.length, stones.length <= 50
         * jewels and stones consist of only English letters.
         * All the characters of jewels are unique.
